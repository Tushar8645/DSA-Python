# Time and Space complexity of Binary Search Tree

|                       | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Create BST            | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Insert a node BST     | O(log n)        | O(log n)         |
| Traverse BST          | O(n)            | O(n)             |
| Search for a node BST | O(log n)        | O(log n)         |
| Delete node from BST  | O(log n)        | O(log n)         |
| Delete entire BST     | O(1)            | O(1)             |
