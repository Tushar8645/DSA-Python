## 1. Create Simply Singly Linked List DS

Write a code in the language of your choice to implement a singly linked list. A singly linked list has the following properties:

- Each node contains a piece of data. Node class constructor  takes a value as an argument and initializes the value attribute of the node.
- Each node also holds a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. A  next attribute, initialized to None, which will store a reference to the next node in the list.
- LinkedList class constructor  takes a value as an argument and creates new node object based on Node class with that value.
- head and tail attributes of the linked list to point to the new node.
- A length attribute, initialized to 1, which represents the current number of nodes in the list.

<br>

## 2. Insertion at the Beginning of a Singly Linked List

Write a function to insert a new element at the beginning of a singly linked list. LinkedList and Node class are already provided.


<br>

## 3. Insertion at the End of a Singly Linked List

Write a method to insert a new element at the end of a singly linked list. The logic should cover edge cases such as empty linked list or linked list with some elements in it.

<br>

## 4. Deletion from a Singly Linked List

Write a function to delete a node from a singly linked list and return deleted_node. The function should take the index(starting from 0) of the node to be deleted as a parameter.

<br>

## 5. Reverse a Singly Linked List

Write a function to reverse a singly linked list. The function should reverse the original linked list.

Example:
<br>
Original singly linked list:   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
<br>
Reversed singly linked list:  5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

<br>

## 6. Middle of a Singly Linked List

Write a function to find and return the middle node of a singly linked list. If the list has an even number of nodes, return the second of the two middle nodes.

<br>

## 7. Remove Duplicates from a Singly Linked List

Given a singly linked list, write a function that removes all the duplicates. use this linked list .

Example:
<br>
Original Linked List - 1 -> 2 -> 4-> 3 -> 4 -> 2
<br>
Result Linked List - 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
